# SrijanToken

SrijanToken is an ERC20 token implemented in Solidity programming. This project is for those who are new to Solidity programming, demonstrating the basic syntax and functionality of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

SrijanToken is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract demonstrates the use of ERC20 tokens, allowing the creation, burning and transfern of tokens. It also includes error handling and pause-unpausing functions in the contract.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

1. Open Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/)

2. Go to the Remix website at Remix Ethereum -> Create a New File

3. Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar and save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., SrijanToken.sol).

4. Add the Contract Code: Copy and paste the SrijanToken contract code into the newly created file.

5. Compile the Code: Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.20" (or above compatible version) and click on the "Compile SrijanToken.sol" button.

6. Deploy the Contract: Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "SrijanToken" contract from the dropdown menu and click on the "Deploy" button.

7. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract by calling its functions through the Remix interface.

8. Import Tokens to Wallet: Use the contract's deployment address to import your SrijanTokens into a compatible wallet on the selected network.
